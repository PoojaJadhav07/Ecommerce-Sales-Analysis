# **Ecommerce Sales Analysis – Interactive Excel Dashboard**

This project is a complete Excel-based Ecommerce Sales Dashboard designed using real multi-year sales data. The dashboard includes KPI tracking, trend analysis, category performance, state-wise sales, sub-category insights, and year-over-year comparisons.

It demonstrates how Excel can be used for end-to-end analytics: data cleaning → KPI creation → pivot tables → charts → final dashboard.
